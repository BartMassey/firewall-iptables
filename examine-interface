# Examine a network interface and set some variables.

# This script is meant to be used like:
#   eval "`examine-interface <prefix> <ifname>`"
# where the first argument is the prefix of the
# variable names that will be set, and the
# second is the name of the network interface.
# The output is Bourne-shell compatible: sorry
# C-shell users.

# The variables set are:
# <prefix>: true if interface exists, false otherwise.
# <prefix>_IP: IP address of interface.
